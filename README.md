Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. Overview

The goal of this analysis is to create a model that helps us decide if someone applying for a loan is likely to pay it back. This model could save a lending company money by spotting loans that might not be repaid and help us make responsible lending choices.

2. Model Performance Metrics

Accuracy
The model is about 99% accurate in its predictions, whether we use the original data or the resampled data. This means it's pretty good at making overall correct guesses.

Precision
When it comes to spotting high-risk loans, the model is about 86% accurate in the original data and 85% accurate in the resampled data. This means that when it says a loan is high-risk, it's right around 85-86% of the time.

Recall
The model can find around 91% of the actual high-risk loans in the original data and about 99% in the resampled data. This is good because it's capturing a lot of the risky loans, especially with the resampled data.

3. Summary and Recommendations

Original Data:

The model is very accurate, about 99%.
It's decent at spotting high-risk loans, about 86%.
It can find around 91% of the actual high-risk loans.
Overall, the model performance is strong.

Resampled Data:

Even after adjusting the data, the model accuracy remains at about 99%.
It's still good at spotting high-risk loans, about 85%.
It's really great at finding high-risk loans, around 99%.
The model performance is still solid with the resampled data.

Recommendation:
Because the model does such a great job on both the original and resampled data, I highly recommend using it for credit risk assessment. It's good at telling us which loans might be risky and which ones are safer. It's especially good at avoiding false alarms. 

In conclusion, the model is a reliable way to check credit risk. It can help make better lending choice and avoid losing money on risky loans.
